# SP_NewsWebsite
## _Modern full-stack single-page app for a local TV station._

eTV News Website is a cloud-enabled and mobile-ready Angular single-page app for a local TV station.
Developed by Matjaž Bevc, Mark Breznik, Blaž Pridgar, and Eva Vidmar for a course in our undergraduate study program Multimedia at the Faculty of Computer Science and Informatics, University of Ljubljana

## Features
Our responsive Angular-based and Bootstrap-designed news website is built on a modern node.js/ express platform with security as a top priority. Throughout the design process, we rethought and deeply tested our platform to adhere to strict standards of user data security in our MongooseDB and all of the middleware code. 
All in all it's an interactive website full of interesting nooks and crannies :D
- Interactive and mobile friendly home-screen showcasing the most recent news

## Tech

DebtSettler uses several open-source projects to work properly:

- Angular - snippety snap, your app is fast!
- jsonwebtoken - keep track of whose's who with privacy
- mongoose - gotta keep the data somewhere ;)
- passport - great web token manager
- node.js - evented I/O for the backend
- Express - fast node.js network app framework
- Swagger - yes, we even offer full REST API documentation :D
- and many more...

And of course, our NewsWebsite is open source!

## Installation

We recommend using AtlasDB for the database host and Heroku for the REST API (node.js with Express) host. Both are reliable, fast and of course - FREE!

## Development

For now, development of our News Website is finished- it was meant as a project for a University course, but we fell in love with the app and just couldn't resist making it public.
