## Tech

DebtSettler uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- Angular - snippity snap, your app is fast!
- jsonwebtoken - keep track of whose's who with privacy
- mongoose - gotta keep the data somewhere ;)
- passport - great webtoken manager
- node.js - evented I/O for the backend
- Express - fast node.js network app framework
- and many more...

And of course our NewsWebsite is open source!

## Installation

We recommend using AtlasDB for the database host and Heroku for the REST API (node.js with Express) host. Both are reliable, fast and of course - FREE!

## Development

For now developement of our News Website is finished- it was meant as a project for a University course, but we fell in love with the app and just couldn't resist making it public.
